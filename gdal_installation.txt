5) setup env variables in settings.py. Look for the bin in venv/condaenv which you installed

for condaenv

run in terminal
cd C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\envs\food_truck_tracker
dir /s /b gdal*.dll - take output of this and set GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH

settings.py
GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = r"C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\envs\food_truck_tracker\Lib\site-packages\osgeo\gdal.dll"
os.environ["GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH"] = GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH



run in terminal
cd C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\envs\food_truck_tracker
